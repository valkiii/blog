abstract: In this thesis I investigate the effects of positive and negative connections on social and organization networks, and the presence and role of homophily in networks of scientific collaborations and citations through the combination of methodologies borrowed from complexity science,statistics, and organizational sciences. In the first part of the thesis, I study the differences between patterns of positive and negative connections among individuals in two online signed social networks. Findings suggest that the sign of links in a social network shapes differently the network topology. There is a positive correlation between the degrees of two nodes, when they share a positive connection, and a negative correlation when they share a negative connection. I then move my focus to the study of a dataset on start-ups from which I construct and analyse the competition and mobility networks among companies. Results show that the presence of competition has negative effects on the mobility of people among companies and on the success of the start-up ecosystem of a nation. Competitive behaviours may also emerge in science. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis, I focus on a database of all papers and authors who have published in the American Physical Society (APS) journals. Through the analysis of the citation network of the APS, I propose a method that aims to statistically validate the presence (or absence) of a citation between any two articles. Results show that homophily is an important mechanism behind the citation between articles, such as, the more two articles share similar bibliographies, i.e., deal with similar arguments, the more likely there is a citation between them.  In the last chapter, I investigate the presence of homophily in the APS data set, this time at the level of the collaboration network among scientists. Results show that homophily can be responsible in fostering collaboration, but above a given point the effect of similarity decreases the probability of a collaboration. Additionally, I propose a model that successfully reproduces the empirical findings.

In this study, I investigate the intricate world of complex networks, focusing specifically on the effects of positive and negative connections within social and organizational networks. The research explores how these connections, along with the principle of homophily where similar individuals tend to connect and shape network structures and dynamics. The thesis is divided into several parts, each addressing different facets of network theory and its implications on social behaviors, scientific collaborations, and start-up ecosystems.

### Data Used
The data utilized in this research is rich and varied, spanning multiple domains. It includes datasets from online signed social networks, which allow for the study of both positive (friendships) and negative (hostilities) connections. Additionally, the thesis examines data from start-up ecosystems, capturing competitive and collaborative interactions among companies. Another significant dataset comes from the American Physical Society (APS) journals, used to analyze citation networks and collaboration patterns among scientists.

### Methodology
The methodologies employed are grounded in complexity science, statistics, and organizational sciences. The study uses network analysis techniques to dissect the patterns of connections—both positive and negative—among individuals and organizations. Key metrics such as degree correlations, clustering coefficients, and homophily indices are calculated to understand how similar nodes are likely to connect.

  <p>For example, the research investigates how competition in start-up ecosystems affects the mobility of professionals and the overall success of the ecosystem. In the case of scientific collaborations, the study introduces methods to statistically validate the likelihood of citations between articles based on their bibliographic similarities.<br>
  
  <br><b>Results:</b>
  
  The findings of this thesis are multifaceted. In the realm of social networks, it is observed that positive connections often correlate with higher degrees of interconnectedness, whereas negative connections tend to segregate nodes, creating more polarized structures.</p>
</div>

 For start-up ecosystems, the presence of competition is shown to negatively impact the mobility of professionals and the overall dynamism of the ecosystem. The study also reveals that homophily significantly influences citation patterns in scientific literature, suggesting that similar works are more likely to reference each other. Interestingly, while homophily can foster collaboration among scientists, beyond a certain threshold, it may reduce the diversity of collaborations, limiting cross-disciplinary innovation.

### Future Works
The thesis opens up several avenues for future research. One promising direction is the further exploration of the interplay between competition and collaboration in different types of organizations and industries. Additionally, there is scope to expand the analysis of homophily and heterophily (the tendency of individuals to connect with those who are different) in broader scientific and academic contexts. Another potential area of study is the development of new models to predict the emergence of positive and negative ties in networks, particularly in the fast-evolving digital and technological landscapes.
