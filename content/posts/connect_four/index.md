## How the AI Works

### 🔗 Ensemble Architecture
Combines 5 CNN-based Deep Q-Networks trained on different amounts of gameplay experience (150k-750k episodes each)

### 🎯 Q-Value Averaging  
Each model predicts Q-values for all moves, then weights are applied and averaged for final decision

### ⚖️ Weighted Strategy
Model weights: 30%, 20%, 20%, 15%, 15% based on training progression and performance

### 🏆 Tournament Proven
Winner of comprehensive tournament against 35+ AI opponents including other ensembles and individual models
